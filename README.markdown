# CFB-Bowl-Pool

This site was developed to manage bowl pool data. It allows users to follow along with updated results after each bowl game, 
displays where everyone stands, and other detailed information. Excel sheets are distributed to collect user's picks. 
The admin can import a single excel file or create a zip file to import multiple files at one time.

Example: [2011-Bowl-Pool](http://sportsbark.com/gbg)

### Why it was developed?

A group of friends have ran this bowl pool for the past 6 years. With over 200 entries they were overwhelmed by entering 
all this data into excel to calculate the totals. They were unable to do this online at a sports site because the group contains 
older people that could not figure out how to sign up and do it properly without getting frustrated.

### Why I am proud of it?

This was my first real go into a framework. A week before bowl season started this year I was able to take what they wanted done 
and have this site fully functioning with all entries in on the day of the first bowl game. There is not a better feeling than when 
you can make life easier for someone and get the 'wow' factor from them when you deliver.
